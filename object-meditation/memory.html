      <p id="line1">The story between the pen and me started in Junior school.</p>
      <p id="line2">My mom gave it to me as a present and encouraged me to practise writing.</p>
      <p id="line3">Since then I have spent a lot of time with it to enhance my skill.</p>
      <p id="line4">At first I focused on Chinese calligraphy, then I also practised English.</p>
      <p id="line5">To me, it is not the skills I learned that made it important to me.</p>
      <p id="line6">It is those memories of hardwork and sweet moments with my friends that made it special.</p>
      <p id="line7">These memories are like the fading text. It is a one way trip.</p>
